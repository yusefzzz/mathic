    b.	Teachers have a maximum number of classes they can create, and students have a maximum number of classes they can join.

5.	Game mode “levels” where each level is a subtopic within a wider topic in the GCSE Mathematics specification.

  	a.	Store student’s progress when logging out.

  	b.	Block next level until current level is done (only for students)

  	c.	Award a number of stars when the user has completed a level (only for students).

9.	Store the number of questions solved and the number of questions right of a student in an online database.

   	a.	Store the number of questions if the student decides to quit the current level they are playing.
